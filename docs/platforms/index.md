# Platforms

OpenClaw core is written in TypeScript. **Node is the recommended runtime**.
Bun is not recommended for the Gateway.

This fork is optimized for Windows-hosted Gateway deployments. Mobile nodes (iOS/Android) can
still pair remotely where needed.

## Choose your OS

- iOS: [iOS](/platforms/ios)
- Android: [Android](/platforms/android)
- Windows: [Windows](/platforms/windows)
- Linux: [Linux](/platforms/linux)

## VPS & hosting

- VPS hub: [VPS hosting](/vps)
- Fly.io: [Fly.io](/install/fly)
- Hetzner (Docker): [Hetzner](/install/hetzner)
- GCP (Compute Engine): [GCP](/install/gcp)
- exe.dev (VM + HTTPS proxy): [exe.dev](/install/exe-dev)

## Common links

- Install guide: [Getting Started](/start/getting-started)
- Gateway runbook: [Gateway](/gateway)
- Gateway configuration: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)
- Service status: `openclaw gateway status`

## Gateway service install (CLI)

Use one of these (all supported):

- Wizard (recommended): `openclaw onboard --install-daemon`
- Direct: `openclaw gateway install`
- Configure flow: `openclaw configure` → select **Gateway service**
- Repair/migrate: `openclaw doctor` (offers to install or fix the service)

The service target depends on OS:

- Windows/WSL2: your Windows shell or WSL-managed process
- Linux: systemd user service (`openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service`)
